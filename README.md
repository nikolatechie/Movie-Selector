# Movie-Selector
**Python** web scraping script that selects around **270 movies** with the best ratings on *IMDb* and puts them in the "Top Movies.csv" file. It scrapes movies from the **two sources**: *Top Rated movies* and *The Most Popular movies*, and then updates ratings of the movies that are present in both lists.
