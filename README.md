# Movie-Selector
**Python** web scraping script that selects around **270 movies** with the best ratings on *IMDb* and puts them in the "Top Movies.csv" file. It scrapes movies from the **two sources**: *Top Rated movies* and *The Most Popular movies*, and then updates ratings of the movies that are present in both lists. At the end, randomly picks one movie from the list and prints its title, year and rating in the console.
